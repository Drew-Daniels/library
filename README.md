# Library website for The Odin Project

- Add in the functionality to check for correct data types before the form is submitted
- Add in the functionality to check for duplicate entries
- Add some kind of icon in the header to make things look nicer
- Re-evaluate the form-submission logic - book entries are getting created when all of the form fields are filled out but the close button is hit instead of the submit button
- Add some kind out outline and background color to the "Add a New Book" button
